## Lab Exercises

[LABS](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300/labs/) is where you'll find the details of every week lab materials and guidance. However, it might change in the future, so I better save a snapshot of the website cotents before the end of this semester. 

How to check the code?
I've written my code and commented them all out. Since each part of exercises is relatively independent, therefore to debug, simply remove the comments on each exercise and start debugging!
